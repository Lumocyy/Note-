# Hardware analysis

## Motherboard

- shortly, motherboard is a hub of all hardware and components in the PC. It act like a brain of the computer and motherboard is a crucial part of the computer.
- The motherboard determines which other hardware components can be used with your computer, such as storage devices that come in a 2.5-inch SATA SSD or an M.2 NVMe SSD form factor.

## CPU (Central Processing Units)

- CPU is the heart or the body of a computer, critical component.
- CPU is responsible for guiding a computer sa it processing some data. It is another crucial components of the computer itself.
- The speed at which is does this is known as ‘clock speed’, and is measured in gigahertz (GHz). A CPU advertising a high GHz rating will likely perform faster than others from the same brand and generation.
- CPU: Intel and AMD, but AMD is known for heavy task and gaming.
- To see the performance/speed of the CPU, then look at the cores.

  ### What are the functios of CPU

  - to allow users to input the instructions
  - to store the instructions
  - to transfer the instruction to it
  - to carry out the commands it issues _(ex. print an essay and display an image)_

  ### How does CPU works?

    _(in short)_

  - CPU works by executing instructions that have been read from memory.
  - The CPU is constantly following instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it. **Without a CPU, we could not run programs on a computer.**
  - The execution cycle: Fetch, Decode, and Execute. _This cycle of course is a loop._

        1. Fetch = Read Instruction from memory at the current instruction pointer. The CPU always reads machine code directly from RAM, and code can’t be run if it isn’t loaded into RAM.
        2. Decode = The CPU works out what the instructions mean.
        3. Execute = carries out the instructions using the ALU for instructions involving logical or mathematical operations. The instruction pointer just keeps chugging forward, executing machine code in the order in which it has been stored in memory.

  ### Main Components of CPU

     1. **Control Unit - CU**
         Coordinates the actions of the computer and controls the fetch-execute cycle by sending out control signals to the other parts of the CPU such as the ALU and registers

     2. **Arithmetic and Logical Unit - ALU**
         Performs arithmetic and logical operations. It carries out activities, such as:
             • addition and subtraction
             • multiplication and division
             • logical tests using logic gates (explained in Chapter 14)
             • comparisons, such as whether one number is greater than another.

     3. **Registers**
        Registers are storage locations within the CPU itself. They can be accessed even more quickly than the RAM. The function of these registers is to store instructions and data that are currently being used in the fetch-execute cycle.

        A register can store instruction, output data, storage address or any kind of data.

  ## RAM (Random Access Memory)

  - RAM is a temporary storage location. The point of RAM is to store data that needs to be readily available for CPU.
  - RAM has various form; DDR1 DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, etc.
  - Dekstop RAM and Laptop RAM is different by structures.
  - If CPU got destroyed/turned off then the RAM will not run, unless the CPU is available or on.

# BIOS and OS

  ## BIOS

  What is Bios? Bios is Basic Input Output System, is a software on a small memory chip, also known as **firmware**. BIOS is found on the motherboard and it is the very first software to run after a computer starts.
  
  
  #### BIOS uses

  - Instructs the computer on how to perform basic function like booting and keyboard control.
  - Identify and configure the hardware in a computer such as the hard drive, CPU, memory, and related equipment.
  - manages data flow between the OS and the attached devices.

#### The 4 function of BIOS

  BIOS **identifies, configures, tests and connects** computer hardware to the OS immediately after a computer is turned on. The combination of these steps is called the boot process.

  These tasks are each carried out by BIOS' four main functions:

  1. **Power-on self test (POST)**,  this tests the hardware of the computer before the OS.
  2. **Bootstrap loader**, this locates the OS.
  3. **Software/drivers**, locates the software and drivers that interface with the OS once running.
  4. **Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) setup**, enable users to alter hardware and system settings.

#### BIOS Manufactures 

  1. Phoenix Technologies
  2. IBM
  3. **Dell**
  4. American Megatrends (AMI)
  5. Insyde Software


## OS (Operating System)

  What is OS? An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages a computer’s hardware and applications by allocating resources, including memory, CPU, input/output devices and file storage.

  ### Functions of an operating system

   - Process management
   - Memory management
   - File system management
   - Device management
   - Security and access control
   - Networking
   - Error detection and handling
   - Resource allocation
   - System performance monitoring

### Components of an operating system

  1. **Kernel**
     
     - Kernel is the **central component of the OS** - it *manages critical system processes and enabling interaction between software and harware*.
     - It handles tasks like; *I/O, CPU manangement, device drivers, file systems and network communication.*

  2. **Process scheduler**
    
     - Allocates CPU time to processes, ensuring efficient resource usage, preventing process monopolization and managing multitasking.
     -  Also, handles context switching to ensure smooth performance across applications.
  
  3. **Memory Manager**

     - Allocates and reallocates memory to processes, managing both RAM and virtual memory.

  4. **Input/Output (I/O) Manager**
    
     - Facilitates data communication between the system and external devices.
     - It handles data transfer, manages device access and ensures error-free communication.
  
  5. **File system manager**

     - Organizes, retrieves and secures files across various file systems (for example, FAT, NTFS).
     - Optimizes access performance, maintains data integrity and enforces permissions.

### Types of Operating Systems

  - Embedded operating systems
  - Distributed operating systems
  - Real-time operating systems
  - Network operating systems
  - Cluster operating systems

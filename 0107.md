# Hardware analysis | Week 1

### Motherboard:
- shortly, motherboard is a hub of all hardware and components in the PC. It act like a brain of the computer and motherboard is a crucial part of the computer.
- The motherboard determines which other hardware components can be used with your computer, such as storage devices that come in a 2.5-inch SATA SSD or an M.2 NVMe SSD form factor.

### CPU (Central Processing Units):
- CPU is the heart or the body of a computer, critical component.
- CPU is responsible for guiding a computer sa it processing some data. It is another crucial components of the computer itself.
- The speed at which is does this is known as ‘clock speed’, and is measured in gigahertz (GHz). A CPU advertising a high GHz rating will likely perform faster than others from the same brand and generation.

    #### What are the functios of CPU
    - to allow users to input the instructions
    - to store the instructions
    - to transfer the instruction to it
    - to carry out the commands it issues _(ex. print an essay and display an image)_

    #### How does CPU works?
    _(in short)_
    - CPU works by executing instructions that have been read from memory.
    - The execution cycle: Fetch, Decode, Execute. _This cycle of course is a loop._
        1. Fetch = Read Instruction from memory at the current instruction pointer
        2. Decode = The Control Unit decodes the instruction to determine what needs to be done.
        3. Execute =

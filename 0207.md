# Linux

## Basic Linux terminal command

1. ``mkdir`` = make directory.
2. ``ls`` = current position / check file or folder.
3. ``cd (file/folder)`` = change directory / move to taegeted directory.
4. ``nano`` = terminal based text editor. [ .txt ]
5. ``rm`` = remove file.
6. ``rmdir`` = remove empty directories.
7. ``cp`` = copy file.
8. ``cd ..`` = move to home directory.
9. ``cp -r`` = recursively copy the contents of the original directory into neew location.
10. ``mv`` = move/rename a file.
    example: move = ```mv 0207.md lnx/w_01/0207.md```
           : rename = ``mv 0207.md 100207.md``
11. ``touch`` =
12. ``chmod`` = change file access permissions.
13. ``echo``  = display a line of text.
14. ``cat``   = display the output of a file.

## Linux file system / Structure

1. ``/bin``, ``/sbin`` = Binaries, it usually contains the shells like ``bash, csh,`` etc. and commonly used commands like ``cp, mv, rm, cat, ls.``
It also contains command which are used indirectly by scripts.

    *system binaries*, however, could only accessed by administrator - not a regular user. It contains command that is important in **single user mode** as opposed to **multi-user** mode.

    Okay, but what is **single user mode**? This is a special mode that boots the user in as a root user, to allow them to do system *repairs/upgrade/testing.*

2. ``/boot`` = contains everything for the OS that needed to boot.

3. ``/dev`` = Device, location of special or device files.

4. ``/etc`` = This is the nerve center of the system, it contains all system related configuration files in here or in its sub-directories. A "configuration file" is defined as a local file used to control the operation of a program.

5. ``/home`` = contains home folders, each users have different home folders. Home folders is where we strore our personal files and documents.

6. ``/lib`` = Libraries, are files that applications can use to perform various functions. It contains: lib32 and lib64

7. ``/mnt``, ``/media`` = where we would find our other mounted drives.

8. ``/opt`` = optional folders, manually installed software from vendors resides here.

9. ``/proc`` = where we will find pseudo files that contain information about system processes and resources.

10. ``/tmp`` = temporary directory, this is where files are temporarily stored by applications that could be used during a session. For example: *when writing a document in a word processor it will regularily saves the file here.*

11. ``/usr`` = user application space, where applications will be installed that used by the user, as opposed to bin directory that is used by the system and system administrator.

12. ``/var`` = Variable directories, it contains files and directories that expected to grow in size. For Example; varcrash holds information about processes that crashed.

## Linux File Permissions

- permission string:

    ```drwxr-xr--```

    What does that mean? That means,
    1. ``d`` = directories
    2. ``r`` = read
    3. ``w`` = write
    4. ``x`` = execute

    Note that owner and group could both ``read, write, and execute.``

- File example:

    ```-rw-rw-r--```

    ( - ) or dash is read as, **file**. That files above means; both owner and group could read and write the files but not execute. And for all user, could read the file but not write nor execute.

    there are also commands to change owner;
    ```chown``

       - for example:
        ```sudo chown zhf 0207.md```
